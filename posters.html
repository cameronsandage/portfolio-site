            <p>I've been lucky enough to be able to design two Artcrank prints over the last few years. I started off in 2013 with "This is my bicycle" for the Portland, OR Artcank show at The Cleaners. And then at the end of 2015 I was able to design "Open Road" for the new online version of Artcrank.</p>

        <p>Whenever I do a personal project, I try and experiment and try new things; this project was no different. But I may have taken it a little too far. When I started to sketch out some ideas of what I wanted to do I kept remembering the Rifleman’s Creed "This is my rifle, there are many like it..." and being in Portland, there are many passionate bikers. I got the assistance from my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kris-cantrell-19259026?authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=XFrF&locale=en_US&trk=tyah&trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CclickedEntityId%3A91010558%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%2Cidx%3A1-3-3%2CtarId%3A1457671148987%2Ctas%3Akris" target="blank" class="peopleInline">Kris</a> who gave me a hand converting the Rifleman’s Creed into the Bicyclist Creed.</p>


        <p class="secondP">Creating a new creed for a poster may have sounded a little nutty. But I wasn't done yet, I decided to enlist the help for screen printer and past classmate <a href="http://www.stusscreenprinting.com/" target="blank" class="peopleInline">Stu</a> to help me with printing this 6 color, 2 sided, 18x24 poster. </p>

        This is my bicycle. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
            <br/><br/>
        My bicycle is my best friend. It is my life. I must mast it as I must master my life. 
            <br/><br/>
        My bicycle, without me, it’s useless. Without my bicycle, I am useless. I must ride my bicycle true. I must ride straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must avoid him before he runs over me. I will…
            <br/><br/>
        My bicycle and I know what counts in this life is not the pedals we pedal, the clank of our chain, nor the route we take. We know that it is the miles that count. We will ride…
            <br/><br/>
        My bicycle is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother, I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its direction and its personality. I will keep my bicycle clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will…
            <br/><br/>
        Before god, I swear this creed. My bicycle and I are the defenders of my lane. We are the masters of our roads. We are the saviors of my life. 
            <br/><br/>
        So be it, until the destination is our and there is no exhaust, but sweat!

            Open Road

        <div id="col_2">
        <p>During the summer of 2014, I moved to Austin, Texas. While I was driving from PDX to ATX I had a lot of time to think, I've also been obsessed with long roads and paths for as long as I can remember. Outside of Marfa, Texas (right in front of the fake Prada store) I took a photo off the road. There was nothing you could see for miles. I held onto this photo for over a year trying to find something to do with it, but not just anything...</p>


        <p class="secondP">I decided to use the photo as the background for this Artcrank print. The ability to clear your mind from chaos and just think, I figured there were other's that had similar feelings. I borrowed my friend <a href="https://www.behance.net/mattcardinal" target="blank" class="peopleInline">Matt's</a> road bikes. Together, we inked up the treads on a giant piece of white paper, then I took it to Kinko’s to get it scanned in, once the tread pattern was digitized I created the pattern that would contain the image from my move. After deciding on a pink to blue split-fountain color palette I shipped it off to <a href="http://finesoutherngentlemen.com/" target="blank" class="peopleInline">Fine Southern Gentleman</a> in Austin for printing. </p>
