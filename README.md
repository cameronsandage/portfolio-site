# portfolio-site
This is my portfolio site. 

It's still very much so a work in progress. I plan on refactoring all my code once the site goes live. I am realy rusty and now have realized I rushed a few things and should take my time to get things to work properly and be symatically correct. 

If you have any suggestions please shoot me a note or post here. 

Thanks!
