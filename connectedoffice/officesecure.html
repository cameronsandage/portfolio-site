            Project Description
            </div>

            <div id="col_2">

            <p>The world is growing at a rapid pace, as is techonlogy, but one thing hasn't kept up. And that's the office experience, if you've ever travled for work to either another office in another city, across the world, or even just across the parking lot getting around is a struggle depending on the infastructure your company has setup for it's self.</p>

            <p class="specialP">My team spent six weeks trying to re-think the office experience, and what we came up with for our internal pitch was called &mdash; Apiary (please note Apairy is the internal name for the project, not something we'd use external and we do not want to confuse our name with the Apairy API service).</p>

            <p class="secondP">Why Apiary? We'll being IBM employees we are reminded of Paul Rands rebus logo with the Bee symbol. But also an Apairy is a collection of beehives, or offices if you will.</p>

            <p class="secondP">After researching, talking to collegues who travel, conducting a few skype calls with various people on twitter or our social networks. We detemined this app wasn't going to solve traveling via plane, boat, car, etc. But was going to focus on three things: The people you needed to meet once you got to the office you where traveling to, the places you needed to be, and the things you needed to work.</p>

            Navigating the pain
            </div>

            <div id="col_2">

            <p>Some of us may have been Brian above, joyfully showing up to a new location to work on some big project, only to find out that he's got no idea where to go, he can't get into the building, nor can he find a meeting room and that girl he did a project with last year &mdash; yeah he's got no idea who she is.</p>

            <p class="secondP">Looking at the user journey flow below, you can see the longer it takes to get a given task done in a new location equates to more time trying to do said task, but also the stress raises. If you looked at just 30 minutes, and your employee makes 93,000 a year, you can actually compute how much money your company is loosing via an employee trying to find where the printer is, how to book a meeting room and who is this random girl asking you how Suzy is.</p>

            <p class="secondP"><span id="large">The weekly average of an employee spending 30 minutes or more trying to do some task equates to roughly 1,200.00 per week, per employee. Or <span id="largeBold">64,000.00 a year.<span></span></p>

 <div class="descriptionHeading">
            The proposed solution
            </div>

            <div id="col_2">

            <p>Overall we decided on few key pieces of technology added with a smart-phone application would not only elevate the stress of an employee navigating un-charted waters. But also help to build better infastructure based on how your employees work, if they are always looking for a printer, we can collect analytics and use analysis to guage the best place to put a printer.</p>

            <p id="secondP">If we tapped into the Employee Database, Campus Directory and Meeting Schedules plus installed iBeacon / Micro Location Aawareness we could make navigation and remembering that girls name a lot easier.</p>

            <p id="secondP">Below are our proposed screen solutions, keep in mind these are just conceptual and have not been built or fully user tested based on the six week timeline. Of the few people we did test, they seemed to like the idea. Expecially of having the employee badge as part of the app and not having to take it out of their pocket to scan into the building. We also designed this as a white label product, and we choose Netflix as our fictional company. </p>
