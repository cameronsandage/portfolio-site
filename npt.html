                <p>One of the very last project I worked on at Nike SPARQ was what we called "The Program," it was a training program devised for high school football programs. And in a nut shell it was a fully imersive training program that any high school program could take and run with. It went as far as to have specific drills on any given day, accomedated for two-a-day practices, focused on the individual athelete as well as the overall system. It also had nutritional information, sleep studies and a few other things as-well.</p>

                <p class="secondP">We planned on rolling this program out to 4 beta schools around the country to see if the program made sense, if the coaches responded well to it, and if the student atheletes where able to be bigger, faster and stronger from the program. </p>

                <p class="secondP">The book was made in two pieces, one the overall program that had drills, day by day break downs etc. that the coach could copy off and pin up or hand out to his team. The other was a drill specific book that showed the proper way for a given excersice to be done. It contained over 100 various movements plus over 400 images and descriptions.</p>

                <p class="secondP">Lastly we wanted the books to be easy to slip into the coaches workflow so we wire bound them, and hole punched the books so they could be slipped into their regular binders. We also created a companion PDF that could be accessed via an iPad which we also sent the coach to have on hand.</p>

                <p class="secondP">Overall I believe the program to successful, and I know there's an app currently out on the market via a Hudl and Nike partnership that I believe contains the essences of this initial pilot. </p>

                <p class="secondP">Please note, I'm working on getting better photos of this project soon.
